Algorithms become fairly simple when your domain and the relationships between the structures representing the domain in question is well thought out.

These structures form an armature which will hence be adorned by which ever material of your choosing. Plastics, perhaps. Materials being algorithms and how you decide to co-locate them.

Functional programming proponents will favor separating actors on data from data as opposed to keeping them within discrete enclosed object as with OOP.

Either way, you must have structure and behavior as the constituents of a working system. If the armature is not built to support the plastic, going from prototype to production becomes burdened by friction.
