A Category is not in itself a mathematical space but a language for speaking in the most generalized sense about such spaces.

Think of them like actors in the actor model of computation.

You send messages to and from service workers by listening to event.

The window object is non existent in a web worker as it runs in a different global execution context than the UI. The global context is hence referred to as `self`

Onlookers are not actual human beings. They're humanoids created by post apocalyptic algorithms to halt human movements whenever there's an interesting scene to behold.. The moment you stop to watch two people fighting on the road, you cease being a human being. You become a subject of the algorithm, a science experiment, a slave to aliens and sky people.

I think myself to be a hedonist.
I see it manifest in my belief that fine girls no dey finish, and that I'm yet to see the finest of them all.

Coupled with this belief is an insatiable desire to explore the essence of womanhood, defying social norms and religious precepts.

I thus declare myself an avid fornicator, a lover of women, a lover with indiscretions wrapped around his neck, a baby boy for life.
