1. Drenched with the
1. Downpour of darkness,
1. Amidst the howl,
1. The bellow,
1. The clamor of nightly beasts,
1. A young lad sits
1. Numb to the whisper of respite.
1. His ears quiver in his palms
1. His flight from toil robs
1. Him the peace of dawn.
1. Shall you close your ears
1. Against tongue lashes
1. And hear the praise when it comes?
1. Shall you not find peace

1. In this endemic tumult?
1. He dresses his demise in immaculate glamour.
1. Aggravate not this strive.
1. In the offing is a plethora
1. Of fine harvests.

1. Kill me on this front oh bastard
1. For this day
1. My life remains nothing
