Drenched with the

Downpour of darkness,

Amidst the howl,

The bellow,

The clamor of nightly beasts,

A young lad sits

Numb to the whisper of respite.

His ears quiver in his palms

His flight from toil robs

Him the peace of dawn.

Shall you close your ears

Against tongue lashes

And hear the praise when it comes?

Shall you not find peace

In this endemic tumult?

He dresses his demise in immaculate glamour.

Aggravate not this strive.

In the offing is a plethora

Of fine harvests.
